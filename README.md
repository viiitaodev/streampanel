## Overview

**Stream Panel** is a desktop application that centralizes the operational workflow of streamers and content creators:
**unified chat**, **activity feeds**, **stream metadata controls**, and a scalable foundation for **multi-platform integrations**
(Twitch, YouTube, Kick, TikTok).

Built with a **real-time** and **modular** architecture, features ship as independent panels while maintaining a consistent UX.
